## T-Rex Run! Game in Arduino using LCD 16x2 shield
    
    
First step in rebranding Google Chrome!

## Repository components
  
The repository contains the .ino file which represents the actual code for the mini-game and the documentation which describes the project. Also, it points out the physical components used in the realisation of the project.
    
## Important note

  The project is not completed yet, as the code doesn't run properly in generating the game map.
